## 📊 Understanding the Publishing Queue

### What is the Queue?
The **Queue** is where all your content awaits publishing. It shows:
- **Pending** 🟡 - Content created but not yet scheduled
- **Scheduled** 🔵 - Content set to publish at a specific time
- **Published** 🟢 - Content that has been published
- **Failed** 🔴 - Content with publishing errors

### Queue Actions
| Action         | What It Does                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **➕ Publish**  | Add this content to more channels          |
| **🗑️ Delete**   | Remove content from queue (cannot undo)    |
| **📅 Calendar** | See all scheduled posts on a calendar view |
| **⏱️ Schedule** | Change when content publishes              |

### Example Queue
```
📺 [Pending] My Awesome Workout Routine
   Platform: YouTube | Status: Pending | Created: Today
   
🔵 [Scheduled] Fitness Tips - Part 1
   Platform: Facebook | Scheduled: Tomorrow 10:00 AM

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Channels Not Showing" in Publish Modal

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Settings** page
2. Ensure at least one platform shows "🟢 Connected" or "🟡 Configured"
3. If all show "🔴 Not Connected", connect them first
4. Wait 2-3 seconds for channels to load
5. If still not showing, refresh the page (F5)

### Problem: "Failed to Schedule Publishing"

**Check:**
1. ✅ At least one channel is selected
2. ✅ Date is not in the past
3. ✅ Internet connection is stable
4. ✅ Browser console has no errors (F12 → Console tab)

**Action:**
- Try again (server might be busy)
- Refresh page: F5
- Clear browser cache: Settings → Clear browsing data
- Restart the app

### Problem: Video Doesn't Publish at Scheduled Time

**Check:**
1. ✅ App/Server is still running (not closed)
2. ✅ Check Queue - does it show "Scheduled"?
3. ✅ Wait 2-3 minutes past scheduled time (slight delays are normal)
4. ✅ Check each channel's direct page (might already be there)

**Action:**
- Manually trigger: Queue → Select video → "Publish Now"
- Check app logs: Open terminal where app is running
- Check Server Status: In Settings, scroll to "Server Status"

### Problem: Same Video Published Twice

**Prevent:**
- Don't click "Schedule Publishing" twice
- Wait for success message before closing modal
- If it happens: Delete duplicate from that platform directly

**Report:**
- Take screenshot showing both posts
- Note: Exact timestamp of both uploads
- Share in app logs or support

### Problem: Channel Connection Lost

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings** page
2. Find the platform showing 🔴
3. Click "Reconnect" or "Connect"
4. Re-authenticate with that service
5. Should show 🟢 **Connected** again

### Problem: "File Size Too Large"

**Solution:**
YouTube Shorts maximum: **128 MB**
- Compress video: Use HandBrake or FFmpeg
- Reduce resolution: 1080p instead of 4K
- Reduce frame rate: 24-30fps instead of 60fps
- Reduce audio bitrate: 128kbps instead of 320kbps

### Problem: Audio Not Working After Upload

**Check:**
1. Original file has audio (test in media player)
2. Audio codec is AAC or MP3
3. File isn't corrupted (re-download if needed)

**Action:**
- Try different video format (MP4 instead of WebM)
- Re-export with audio enabled
- Use pre-made template with audio included
